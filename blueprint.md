Notes
AI-First Approach:

Gemini 1.5 Integration: Central to platform - powers public chat, broker tools, brochure processing, lead scoring
3500 Projects Scale: AI must handle large dataset efficiently with vector embeddings for fast retrieval
Dual AI Personalities: Public AI is helpful and conversion-focused; Broker AI is concise and action-oriented
Context Management: Carefully manage token limits with conversation summarization and selective context
Brochure Automation: Game-changing feature for brokers - must be robust and accurate
AI Testing: Test AI responses for accuracy, tone, and conversion effectiveness

Dubai Market Focus:

Dubai-Specific Content: All content emphasizes Dubai market, international buyer benefits, Golden Visa eligibility
3500 Real Projects: Platform must scale to handle large inventory with performant filtering and search
International Buyers: Forms capture country, language preference, visa interest, investment goals
Golden Visa: Prominently featured throughout (badges, filters, dedicated page, AI mentions)

Platform Architecture:

Project Pages as Landing Pages: Each project page must be complete, standalone, SEO-optimized, and ready to advertise independently
Broker Dashboard, Not Client: Dashboard is for sales team management, not end-user portal
CRM Integration: Lead management with AI is core broker feature
Currency & Units: Support AED/USD toggle, sqft/sqm toggle throughout

Technical Details:

Dark/Light Mode: Sophisticated theme system with soft dark gray (NOT pure black), smooth transitions, persistent preference, system detection
Theme Colors: Gold accents remain vibrant in both modes, dark mode uses elevated grays (#1C1C1E, #2C2C2E) for luxury feel
Mock Data First: Start with comprehensive mock data for Dubai properties and projects (Marina, Downtown, Palm, etc.)
Component Reusability: Create reusable components early (PropertyCard, AIChatInterface, ProjectHero, ContactCTA) - all theme-aware
Mobile-First: Responsive design with special attention to AI chat interface on mobile
Performance: Skeleton loaders, lazy loading, optimized images, AI response streaming for better UX
Luxury Aesthetics: Gold gradient theme works in both modes, elegant serif headings, premium imagery, subtle animations
Chart Theming: All data visualizations (Recharts) adapt colors to current theme
Image Optimization: Ensure images look good on both light and dark backgrounds (use appropriate overlays)
Conversion Focus: Multiple prominent CTAs, trust signals, urgency/scarcity, AI-guided discovery
SEO: Each page (especially projects) has unique meta tags, structured data, social sharing tags
Trust Signals: Developer credentials, broker license, testimonials, market stats, AI-powered insights
