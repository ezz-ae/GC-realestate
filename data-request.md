Gold Century Data Agent Request

Goal
Fix media uniqueness at the data level and document data structures for PDFs, users, and leads. Data work should happen in the backend (Neon) so the frontend only reads.

Scope (Backend Data Only)
1) Media Uniqueness (gc_projects)
Replace all repeated image URLs with deterministic, unique Picsum URLs (no Unsplash).
- hero_image and payload.heroImage: unique per project
- og_image and payload.ogImage: match hero_image
- payload.gallery[]: 8-12 unique images per project
- payload.units[].floorPlan: unique per project + unit type
- payload.units[].interiorImage: unique per project + unit type
- masterplan, brochure, virtualTour: leave as-is
- hero_video: keep area-based mapping (shared is OK)

2) Lead Storage (gc_leads)
Ensure table exists and is used by the API that creates branded PDFs for public users.
Columns (existing or add if missing):
- id (text, primary key)
- name (text)
- phone (text)
- email (text, nullable)
- source (text, nullable)
- project_slug (text, nullable)
- assigned_broker_id (text, nullable)
- created_at (timestamptz, default now())

3) Users and Roles
Create a minimal users table to support role-based access for the dashboard.
Suggested table: gc_users
- id (text, primary key)
- name (text)
- email (text, unique)
- role (text: 'admin' | 'broker')
- created_at (timestamptz, default now())

Optional mapping table (if needed): gc_brokers
- id (text, primary key)
- user_id (text, FK to gc_users)
- display_name (text)
- phone (text)

4) Lead Assignment Rules
- Admin: can see all leads and assign to any broker.
- Broker: can see only leads where assigned_broker_id matches their broker/user id.
- Assignments stored in gc_leads.assigned_broker_id.

5) PDF Generation Data
Branded PDFs are generated by the frontend API and should pull from these fields:
- Project: payload.heroImage, payload.gallery, payload.units, payload.paymentPlan, payload.timeline, payload.investmentHighlights
- Developer: payload.developer (name/logo/trackRecord)
No frontend-side data mutation is expected.

Implementation Notes
- Use Picsum for all images:
  hero: https://picsum.photos/seed/{slug}-hero/1600/1000
  gallery: https://picsum.photos/seed/{slug}-g{index}/1600/1000
  floorPlan: https://picsum.photos/seed/{slug}-{unitType}-plan/1200/900
  interior: https://picsum.photos/seed/{slug}-{unitType}-interior/1200/900
- Ensure payload JSON and top-level columns remain in sync.
- Keep hero_video as area-based (shared allowed).

Deliverables
- Updated gc_projects with unique media.
- Verified gc_leads table schema.
- New gc_users table (role-based).
- (Optional) gc_brokers table if needed.

Verification Queries
1) Media uniqueness:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total, COUNT(DISTINCT hero_image) AS distinct_hero FROM gc_projects;
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT payload->'gallery'->>0) AS distinct_gallery0 FROM gc_projects;

2) Leads:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gc_leads;

3) Users:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gc_users;
